## Summary
This paper examines Physics Lab, a mobile app that has successfully engaged more than 7 million global learners in informal STEM learning activities. The study addresses the global challenge of engaging youth in STEM learning online, where participants construct and share simulation-based projects within a vibrant online community.

Through analysis of the platform's evolution and community dynamics, we identified three key design principles that foster learner agency:
1. **Goal generation and problem-solving** - Supporting open-ended exploration and creative experimentation
2. **Social interaction** - Enabling collaborative learning and peer support
3. **Social governance** - Fostering youth ownership and leadership in community management

## Implications

This research provides crucial insights for designing informal STEM learning environments that can:
- Scale to millions of learners globally
- Foster genuine learner autonomy and agency
- Support sustainable, youth-led community governance
- Bridge formal and informal STEM education contexts

The success of Physics Lab challenges conventional assumptions about adult supervision in online learning spaces and demonstrates the potential of well-designed platforms to empower youth as active creators, collaborators, and community leaders in STEM learning.
