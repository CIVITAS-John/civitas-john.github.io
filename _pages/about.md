I am John (Yuehan) Chen, a tenure-track assistant professor in Game Design and Development at **the University of Arizona, College of Information Science**. I recently defended my Ph.D dissertation in Computer Science and Learning Sciences at Northwestern University under the supervision of Prof. Uri Wilensky. 

I am hiring 1-2 Ph.D students and summer research students in **Fall 2026**. Please reach out to me if your research interest is at the intersection of Human-AI Interaction, Playful Learning, and Generative AI. 

As a human-computer interaction and learning researcher, I study how to leverage **AI-driven technologies**, such as Generative AI (GAI) or Mixed Reality, to **promote equal access to playful informal learning at scale**. Before and since I came to Northwestern, I have led the research, design, and development of [Physics Lab AR](/portfolio/physics-lab) and [Turtle Universe](/portfolio/turtle-universe), App Store-featured software, reaching 7 million online, out-of-school learners worldwide. More recently, I developed [Vox Deorum](/portfolio/vox-deorum), a hybrid LLM architecture for Civilization V, opening new pathways for integrating Generative AI models into strategic game design for learning and fun.

My real-world projects have produced large-scale human interaction datasets that challenge existing research methodologies. To augment researchers’ capabilities in understanding them, I develop and evaluate novel computational approaches with **GAI for inductive qualitative coding**, with a focus on bias detection (accepted by CSCL 2025 and AERA 2025). 

Throughout my career, I constantly learn from and work with learners of diverse ages and backgrounds. With my extensive experiences in research (incl. leadership), teaching, mentoring, and grant writing, I am looking forward for the next stage of independent research career.
